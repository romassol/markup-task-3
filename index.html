                <h2>Small Donors Equal Big Dollars, Lifting Democrats’ Fund-Raising</h2>
                <p lang="en">
                    An army of Democrats giving money over the internet has lifted the party’s House
                    candidates to a strong financial advantage over Republicans in the final weeks of the
                    2018 midterm election, with Democrats in the most competitive House races outraising
                    their Republican rivals by more than $78 million. Democratic challengers have outpaced
                    Republican incumbents in large part by drawing in millions of dollars from many thousands
                    of supporters online — a strategy wielded by Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders in
                    presidential elections but never replicated on a massive scale in House races, until now.
                    Across the 69 most competitive House races, Democrats have raised a total of $46 million
                    from small donors during the 2018 election, compared with just $15 million for their
                    Republican opponents, according to campaign finance data released this week. Democrats
                    have taken in $252 million altogether in those races over the course of the campaign,
                    versus $172 million for Republicans. The gap in small donors accounts for about 40
                    percent of the Democrats’ overall financial advantage. Nicco Mele, director of Harvard’s
                    Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, said the breakout fund-raising
                    by Democratic congressional candidates reflected a confluence of two. The inquiry is
                    believed to be the first statewide investigation by the federal government of the
                    church’s sex abuse problems. And it comes two months after the Pennsylvania attorney
                    general’s office released an explosive grand jury report charging that bishops and other
                    church leaders had covered up the abuse of more than 1,000 people over a period of more
                    than 70 years. Seven of the eight dioceses in the state, Philadelphia, Erie, Harrisburg,
                    Scranton, Pittsburgh, Greensburg and Allentown, all said they had received federal grand
                    jury subpoenas from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of
                    Pennsylvania requesting documents. The eighth, Altoona-Johnstown, did not respond to a
                    request for comment. “This subpoena is no surprise considering the horrific misconduct
                    detailed in the statewide grand jury report,” said the Diocese of Greensburg in a
                    statement. “Survivors, parishioners and the public want to see proof that every diocese
                    has taken sweeping, decisive and impactful action to make children safer.”

                        BOSTON — The deliberations that take place inside 86 Brattle Street, a red brick
                        building where Harvard University’s admissions committee convenes, have very much
                        stayed inside 86 Brattle Street. Until now. A federal trial that began this week
                        accusing Harvard of stacking the deck against Asian-American applicants is providing
                        a rare glimpse into the secretive selection process at one of the country’s most
                        elite universities. It is as if those sitting on the wood benches before Judge
                        Allison D. Burroughs of Federal District Court in Boston have been invited inside the
                        inner sanctum of the Harvard Office of Admissions and Financial Aid. There is the
                        longtime dean of admissions, William Fitzsimmons (Harvard Class of 1967), on the
                        stand, grilled on whether rural students receive a leg up over urban students. They
                        do. There on a big screen are his emails with the university’s fundraisers,
                        suggesting special consideration for the offspring of big donors, those who have
                        “already committed to a building” or have “an art collection which could conceivably
                        come our way.” Grades, test scores, intended major, personality ratings, ethnicity —
                        all the various factors that can help turn an anonymous high school student into a
                        Harvard man or Harvard woman are being dissected for all to see. Those arrested
                        included 15 men who were sent to confront Mr. Khashoggi, plus one driver and two
                        consular staff, a Saudi official said. Saudi state media reported that Saud
                        al-Qahtani, a close aide to the crown prince, had been dismissed, along with Maj.
                        Gen. Ahmed al-Assiri, the deputy director of Saudi intelligence, and other
                        high-ranking intelligence officials. The Saudi official said General Assiri had
                        organized the operation and that Mr. Qahtani had known about it and contributed to
                        an aggressive environment that allowed it to escalate.

                <h2>‘INFORMATION WARFARE’</h2>
                <h2 class="uppercase">Citing reports, Trump concedes writer is dead</h2>
                <h3>President Stops Short of Implicating the Saudi Crown Prince</h3>
                <p>
                    WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Thursday that he believes the Saudi journalist Jamal
                    Khashoggi is dead, and he expressed confidence in intelligence reports from multiple
                    sources that strongly suggest a high-level Saudi role in Mr. Khashoggi’s assassination.
                    Mr. Trump stopped short of saying the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, was
                    responsible for Mr. Khashoggi’s death. But he acknowledged that the allegations that the
                    prince ordered the killing raised hard questions about the American alliance with Saudi
                    Arabia and had ignited one of the most serious foreign policy crises of his presidency.
                    “This one has caught the imagination of the world, unfortunately,” Mr. Trump said in a
                    brief interview with The New York Times in the Oval Office. “It’s not a positive. Not a
                    positive.” The shift in the president’s tone came shortly after a briefing by Secretary
                    of State Mike Pompeo, and it signaled that after trying to defend the Saudi rulers, Mr.
                    Trump was coming to terms with the far-reaching implications of the Khashoggi case and
                    the likelihood that his closest ally in the Arab world was guilty of the grisly killing
                    of a Saudi-born columnist for The Washington Post. “Unless the miracle of all miracles
                    happens, I would acknowledge that he’s dead,” Mr. Trump said. “That’s based on everything
                    — intelligence coming from every side.” Later, before leaving on a trip to Montana, he
                    was asked what the consequences would be if Saudi Arabia’s culpability was established.
                    “Well, it’ll have to be very severe,” he said. “I mean, it’s bad”.

                <h2>An Insider in Florida Politics, Running for Office as an Outsider</h2>
                <p>
                    TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — City Hall never did seem big enough for Andrew Gillum. It was
                    November 2014 — Mr. Gillum’s swearing-in as mayor of Tallahassee — and typical
                    accommodations would not do. Traditionally, the city had inaugurated its new government
                    quietly, in its municipal chambers. But Mr. Gillum, then 35, wanted a party. He wanted,
                    colleagues groused, to be seen making a speech. And seen he was. “I won’t always get it
                    right, but I’ll be honest,” Mr. Gillum said in an outdoor address, as a constellation of
                    lobbyists, friends and lobbyist-friends at the city’s tailgatestyle festival looked on —
                    their faith and investment in him rewarded. “We’ve got some good times ahead, y’all.”
                    Four years and one long-shot campaign later, this has proved true for Mr. Gillum. With
                    his upset victory in the Democratic primary for governor in August, Mr. Gillum, 39, has
                    continued on a glide path to the party’s upper reaches that began about a mile down the
                    road, as a student government leader at Florida University, before he was old enough
                    to drink. He may be elected the first black governor of the nation’s largest swing state
                    in November, as his race against former Representative Ron DeSantis, a Trump acolyte who
                    just turned 40, emerges as a national proxy for the parties’ dueling futures. Mr.
                    Gillum’s admirers see in him a hybrid of Bernie Sanders and Barack Obama — an authentic
                    progressive who supports higher corporate taxes and greater gun control, calls for the
                    impeachment of President Trump and Medicare for all, and can inspire young and minority
                    voters in a state that last elected a Democratic governor in 1994. And in recent days,
                    he has been ubiquitous, in his city and on television, as he managed the fallout from
                    Hurricane Michael.

                <h2>Anti-Abortion Push in Missouri (And Not Only Within G.O.P.)</h2>
                <p>
                    ST. LOUIS — Joan Barry has been a member of the Missouri Democratic Party for 53 years.
                    As a state legislator, she voted regularly for workers’ rights, health care and programs
                    for the poor. So when the party began writing a new platform after its crushing losses
                    in 2016, Ms. Barry, a member of its state committee, did not think it was too much to ask
                    for a plank that welcomed people like her — Democrats who oppose abortion. At first the
                    party agreed and added it. Missouri’s Democratic senator, Claire McCaskill, even called
                    Ms. Barry to praise her. But within days, Ms. Barry began receiving angry emails and
                    Facebook messages. People called her a dinosaur, a has-been and worse. Her children
                    started to worry. “My daughter called me and said, ‘Mom, your life is in danger,’” Ms.
                    Barry, 77, said in her home in suburban St. Louis. “‘You’d better get some mace.’” For
                    most of its history, Missouri was a barometer of the American middle. For a century, it
                    voted for the eventual winner of every presidential election except one. But in 2008,
                    Missouri broke with its past, voting against the winning candidate, Barack Obama. By the
                    end of his presidency, Democratic fortunes had declined precipitously, dragged down by
                    raw culture war battles that plagued the state.
